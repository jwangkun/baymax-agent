## üöÄ Installation

### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip or uv package manager
- Network connection (for API calls and data retrieval)

### Using pip

```bash
pip install baymax-agent
```

### Using uv (Recommended)

uv is a modern Python package manager that provides faster installation speeds and better dependency resolution:

```bash
uv add baymax-agent
```

Note: If you encounter errors when running this command in the project directory due to the project name conflicting with the dependency name, use one of the following commands:

1. For development environment installation:
   ```bash
   uv add --dev baymax-agent
   ```

2. If you just want to install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. If you want to use baymax in a new project:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   uv add baymax-agent
   ```

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jwangkun/baymax-agent.git
cd baymax-agent
pip install -e .
```

### Installation Verification

After installation, you can verify the installation was successful by running:

```bash
baymax --version
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file and add the necessary API keys (at least one LLM provider API key is required):

```bash
# Copy the example configuration file
cp env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add the necessary API keys:

```bash
# LLM API Keys (configure at least one)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key

# Optional: Custom model configuration
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1

    "default_period": "quarterly",
    "historical_years": 5
  }
}
```

## üìä Data Sources & Limitations

### Data Sources
BayMax Agent uses free data sources for stock analysis, primarily relying on:

- **AkShare**: Free open-source financial data interface library
  - Provides A-shares, US stocks, Hong Kong stocks market data
  - Data sources include Sina Finance, Tencent Finance, East Money
  - No API key required for access
  - Data update frequency and stability depend on source websites

### Important Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Data Quality**:
   - Uses free data sources, data accuracy depends on third-party websites
   - May have delays, missing data, or errors
   - Recommend cross-validation with official data sources for important decisions

2. **Network Dependency**:
   - Requires stable network connection to access data sources
   - Some data sources may have access frequency limits
   - Network issues may cause data retrieval failures

3. **Real-time Capability**:
   - Not professional real-time market data
   - Stock price data may have 15-20 minute delays
   - Financial data updated according to official release cycles

4. **Coverage Scope**:
   - Mainly covers A-shares and US stock markets
   - Hong Kong stock market support is limited
   - Other international markets not currently supported

5. **AI Model Limitations**:
   - Currently only supports DeepSeek model
   - Analysis results are AI model-based and for reference only
   - Does not constitute investment advice

## üîå MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

BayMax Agent now supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing external applications and AI assistants to access its financial analysis capabilities through a standardized HTTP interface.

### üöÄ Starting the MCP Server

#### Prerequisites
Ensure required dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install fastmcp
```

#### Startup Steps
1. **Configure environment variables** (if not already configured):
```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

2. **Start the MCP server**:
```bash
python mcp_server.py
```

3. **Verify successful startup**:
After starting, you should see:
```
üöÄ Starting BayMax Agent MCP Server in HTTP mode...
üåê HTTP endpoint: http://0.0.0.0:8000
üì¶ Transport: HTTP
üîó Server URL: http://0.0.0.0:8000/mcp
```

#### Server Features
- **Transport**: HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8000/mcp`
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Concurrency**: Supports multiple simultaneous client connections

#### Connection Testing
After starting, you can test with:
```bash
# Test server status
curl -N -H "Accept: text/event-stream" http://localhost:8000/mcp

# If SSE format data is returned, server is running normally
```

### üîß Configuration & Troubleshooting

#### Environment Configuration
The MCP server supports environment variables for configuration:

```bash
# Optional: Set log level
export BAYMAX_LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Optional: Set default model for AI analysis
export BAYMAX_DEFAULT_MODEL=deepseek

# Optional: Set API timeout
export BAYMAX_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=30
```

#### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: Server fails to start**
```bash
# Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastmcp'
# Solution:
pip install fastmcp
```

**Issue 2: API call failures**
```bash
# Error: DeepSeek API error
# Solutions:
# 1. Check if API key is correct
# 2. Check network connection
# 3. Verify API quota is not exhausted
```

**Issue 3: Data retrieval failures**
```bash
# Error: Network error: US price fetch failed
# Solutions:
# 1. Check network connection
# 2. Wait for network recovery and retry
# 3. Try alternative data sources
```

**Issue 4: MCP client connection failures**
```bash
# Error: Connection refused
# Solutions:
# 1. Confirm server is running
# 2. Check port number is correct (8000)
# 3. Check firewall settings
```

#### Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Caching**: Same queries are cached to reduce API calls
2. **Batch queries**: Get data in batches to reduce network requests
3. **Error retry**: Network failures automatically retry up to 2 times
4. **Timeout settings**: Set reasonable timeout to avoid long waits
